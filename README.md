Subject: Update on SC Parameters and Environment Variable Configuration

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to inform you that the environment variables in your SC params files, located in your respective SC-params repositories, which you are currently using for provisioning SC products, can now be replaced dynamically by the environment you select when running the pipeline.

To implement this change, simply replace the existing environment variable (e.g., dev, sit, etc.) with “varEnvironment” in the SC params file. During runtime, the “varEnvironment” placeholder will automatically be replaced with the actual environment parameter that you select in the pipeline.

Should you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]
[Your Contact Information]

Let me know if any additional details are needed!
